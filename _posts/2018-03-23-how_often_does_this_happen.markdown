When I sit down and take a look at the position I'm in today, I'm always surprised. I don't know how it's possible to be where I'm at today; I have everything I could've ever wanted. One day, I'll be coding and doing graphic design as my profession. My first grade self would be thrilled. I've got a great job right now to do in the meantime, though, which I'm still more grateful for than I could ever say. I really don't know how I always end up getting so lucky, but I'm in a spot that a year ago I never thought I would be able to reach. I love learning more coding and building on what I know right now. I still have a long ways to go, and honestly, it's been a slower process than I hoped it would be, but at the end of the day, I'm doing what I want to do and I am beyond thankful for that.
