Since I was a little girl, I've loved desiging web pages. I can't remember a time in my life where I wasn't sitting at my computer, designing graphics and (poorly) coding web layouts. 

I took a couple of classes for web design in high school, but only learned the basics of HTML and CSS, which I already knew from the coding I did when I was young. After that, I strayed away from coding for many years as I received a college education in Linguistics.

I realized after I finished my schooling in Linguistics how much I wished I could go back to web design. Although I love science and learning other languages, it is more of a hobby for me --- not a career path I want to one day pursue. Upon realizing this, I decided to join Flatiron to finally learn some real code after so many years of being self-taught. I love doing this and hope to one day make this my career.
